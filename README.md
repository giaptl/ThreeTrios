## How to Play

The Three Trios game is a strategic card-based board game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing cards from their 
hand onto empty grid cells. Each card has four values (North, South, East, West) that determine its strength in battles with 
adjacent cards. When a card is placed, it can flip opponent's cards if the attacking value is higher than the defending value 
of adjacent cards. The game supports various battle rules: Normal (higher value wins), Reverse (lower value wins), FallenAce 
(Ace loses to 1), Same (flips cards with matching values in opposing directions), and Plus (flips cards when sums match in 
opposing directions). Players can choose between human and AI opponents with different strategies (Corner, FlipMaximizer, 
LeastLikelyFlipped). The game ends when all cells are filled, and the player with the most cards on the board wins.
