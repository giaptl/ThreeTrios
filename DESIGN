Design Document for ThreeTrios Game

Overview:
This document outlines the design of the ThreeTrios game, focusing on the player interface and how
different player implementations (human and AI) can interact with the game model. The goal is to
create a flexible design that allows for various player types and game scenarios, including human
vs. computer and fully automated play.

INCLUDE: It's the result of an object-oriented analysis for a player object. What behaviors does it
have? Is there anything the client can assume about its representation / what is known about players
without diving into their implementation (that should not yet exist).
